**This is a fun little section to put on a readme, which allows viewers to vote on a controversial programming debate.**

Every 8 hours, a Github Action is set to pick a new question and reset the counts. There are buttons to vote, which send a request to a remote server, which manages the counts.

Your vote may not appear instantly, due to Github Image caching. A Github Action force resets the cache every 30 minutes, otherwise wait a few minutes and it may appear.

## Usage
1. Fork this repository.
2. Use [Nest](https://hackclub.app) or similar to host `server.py` (a flask app)
3. Update all references to `https://froggerapi.madavidcoder.hackclub.app` within `updater.py` and the below snippet, to the url that your flask app listens to.
4. Add the below snippet into your `README.md` file, to display the questions:
    ```
